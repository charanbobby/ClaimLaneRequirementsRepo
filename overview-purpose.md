# Overview and Purpose

Silk & Snow aims to replace an ad-hoc email-based return and warranty process with Claimlane, a guided self-service portal covering returns, replacements and warranty claims.

The portal enforces policies consistently while reducing service workload.

## Objectives

- Provide a self-service portal for returns, warranty claims and replacements.
- Automate eligibility checks, documentation, refunds and replacement orders.
- Reduce label/documentation errors and prevent incorrect returns.
- Deliver structured data for analytics and reporting.
- Ensure policy-driven customer experience across CA and US.

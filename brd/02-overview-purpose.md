# Overview and Purpose

Silk & Snow aims to replace an ad-hoc email-based return and warranty process with Claimlane, a guided self-service portal covering returns, replacements and warranty claims.

The portal must enforce trial, return, warranty and refund policies consistently while reducing customer-service workload through automation.

This document consolidates the requirements extracted from the provided BRD, return reason mappings, warranty/return policy tables and testing worksheet. It identifies functional and non-functional requirements, business rules, constraints, dependencies, risks, assumptions, epics, user stories and acceptance criteria, and highlights gaps or ambiguities.

## Objectives

- Provide a self-service portal that guides customers through returns, warranty claims and replacements.
- Automate eligibility checks, document collection, refund processing and replacement order creation where supported.
- **Implement region-specific logistics flows (CA vs US) for furniture and accessories, routing returns to appropriate warehouse destinations.**

- **Support offline warehouse operations via email-based status updates for US facilities (LA/NJ) through Internal Ops team.**

- **Optimize return costs through multi-tier offer logic for US accessories (50% keep offer, 100% donate offer with proof).**

- **Automatically route defective returns to warranty flow with customer opt-out mechanism.**

- Reduce label and documentation errors and prevent incorrect returns.
- Deliver structured data for defect analytics, lot tracking, vendor and customer-service reporting.
- Ensure a consistent, policy-driven customer experience across Canada and the United States.

# Open Questions

These issues require clarification from Silk & Snow before implementation:

1. **Shipping Integration Provider** – Which carrier (FedEx, EasyPost or other) will be used at launch? This affects label generation and pickup logic.

2. **Label Coverage** – Which products/categories receive automatic return labels? For example, are furniture labels supported for all categories or only select ones?

3. **Marketing Approval** – What is the final approval process for all portal wording in English and French? This includes copy for error messages, eligibility notices, warnings and help pages.

4. **Donation Automation** – Will open-box mattress donation programs be integrated or require manual handling?

5. **POS Ticketing** – Should POS returns create Claimlane tickets for analytics even if refunds are processed manually in store?

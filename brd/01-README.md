# How to Use This BRD

## Purpose

This Business Requirements Document - Claimlane Returns, Refunds and Warranty Portal - defines how Silk & Snow will replace an ad-hoc email-based returns and warranty process with a guided self-service portal. It describes the portal's objectives, scope, actors, high-level flows, functional and non-functional requirements, business rules, constraints, dependencies, risks, assumptions, epics, user stories and identified gaps.

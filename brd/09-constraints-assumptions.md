# Constraints and Assumptions

## Constraints

- The portal is restricted to orders in Canada and the United States.
- POS returns remain mostly manual at launch; the portal may display guidance but does not fully automate POS refund processing.
- Multi-language support is not available at launch (English only); French copy exists but requires marketing approval before use.
- Fraud detection or abuse prevention is outside the scope of this project.

## Assumptions

- All product SKUs are correctly tagged with return and warranty periods and are up to date in the product master.
- Delivered dates are available for 100% of orders via Trackship or a similar service.
- Customers provide clear uploads for documentation, and policies for retail/POS returns are communicated to customer service.
- API credentials for WooCommerce and shipping providers are available and valid.

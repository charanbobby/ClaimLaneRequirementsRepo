The portal shows vendor instructions only.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-2 \u2013 Order Security: No order details are displayed unless both the email and order number match the WooCommerce record exactly.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-3 \u2013 Item Selection Requirement: At least one item must be selected to proceed with a return or claim.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-4 \u2013 Maximum Quantity: [MOVED to Phase 2 Backlog] The rule limiting returns to a maximum of two units per product type has been deferred.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-5 \u2013 Complete Documentation: A claim cannot be submitted until 100% of required documentation (photos, measurements, lot number, description and invoice where applicable) is provided and validated at submission, except when customer service manually overrides. (Consolidates former A-1 and BR-10.)</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-6 \u2013 Freight &amp; Oversize: Freight or oversize rules apply for furniture, adjustable beds and oversized items; the system must enforce a CX Pre-Approval step before any labels are generated or pickups arranged.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-7 \u2013 Duplicate Ticket Prevention: The system must prevent the creation of multiple tickets for the same items within a short window (specific timeframe configurable).</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-8 \u2013 Eligibility Calculation: Eligibility must be computed using delivered_date + return_period (see return windows). Past the window, items are not eligible.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-9 \u2013 Warranty Check: Warranty claims remain available even after the return window has closed.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-11 \u2013 Return Reason Mapping: Refunds must use the mapped WooCommerce reason for reporting and processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-12 \u2013 Duplicate Refunds: No duplicate refund attempts are allowed; the system must detect prior refunds before initiating a new one.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-13 \u2013 Retail Store Backend Detection: When a customer selects \"Silk &amp; Snow Retail Store,\" the portal must lookup the backend:</p> <ul> <li>Shopify POS: Route to standard Shopify flow.</li> <li>STORIS: Block online return; show \"In-store return only\" message. No tickets, labels, or refunds are generated in the portal.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>BR-15 \u2013 Bundle / Free Item 50% Keep Rule: When a bundle item is returned and the customer keeps the bundled/free item, the customer pays 50% of the full website price for the kept item. The refund is adjusted (prorated) to reflect this charge and the decision is recorded on the ticket. Note: This requires custom code integration to bridge the WooCommerce data structure with the portal.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-16 \u2013 Vendor Pickup and Status Updates: Vendors (or Logistics team) must update mattress status to \"Picked\" in the portal. This status update must transition the item to \"Received\" to trigger refund logic.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-17 \u2013 Furniture Return Process: The system must calculate and present return shipping charges (via WooCommerce service) before ticket submission. The customer must agree to pay the charge (or have it deducted). Note: Disposal pickups use the same charge as the courier rate. Once the customer accepts and submits, the ticket enters CX Review. Only upon CX Approval (of photos + charge) does the system automatically generate labels and pickup instructions.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-18 \u2013 Accessory and Bedding Mail-In Flow: These items follow a single-step logistics flow: Reason/Photos -&gt; Label Generation -&gt; Mail-in.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-19 \u2013 Caledonia Limited Access Role: Caledonia team uses a limited role to update status: Delivered -&gt; Processing / Inspection Completed.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-20 \u2013 Store Ops Returned Items Report: Store Ops must be able to generate a report of items in \"Inspection Completed\" status for inventory updates.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-21 \u2013 Automatic Refund Threshold (&lt; 600):</p> <ul> <li>Net Refund Value &lt; 600: Auto-Refund initiated (if gateway supported).</li> <li>Net Refund Value &gt;= 600: Manual Refund (routed to CX).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>BR-22 \u2013 Return Label Limitation: The number of return labels generated cannot exceed the number of boxes/labels in the original order.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-23 \u2013 US Accessory Keep Offer: For US opened accessories, the customer MUST be offered Option 1 (keep item for 50% refund, no proof required) before declining the return. This offer applies to both opened items and high-cost unopened items (shipping &gt; 1/3 value).</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-24 \u2013 US Accessory Donate Offer: If the customer rejects Option 1 (50% keep), the system MUST present Option 2 (donate item for 100% refund with CX-verified proof via call/email). The return can only be declined if BOTH offers are rejected.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-25 \u2013 Shipping Cost Threshold: For US unopened accessories/bedding, if the calculated shipping cost exceeds 1/3 of the item value, the system MUST skip label generation and present the keep/donate offers instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-26 \u2013 Auto-Refund Bundle Exclusion: Automatic refunds are strictly prohibited for any order containing bundles or free items, regardless of refund value. All such orders MUST route to manual refund processing. This is a Phase 1 technical limitation due to the custom implementation required for bundle calculation (WF-070\u2192073).</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-27 \u2013 Warranty Label Wording: Courier pickup labels generated for warranty claims MUST include the text \"(Defective)\" or \"(Defective - this will help warehouse to avoid inspection of that piece)\" to signal the warehouse team to bypass standard inspection procedures.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-28 \u2013 US Warehouse Offline Processing: US warehouse (LA/NJ) status updates are processed via email to Internal Ops, not through direct portal access. The portal MUST support manual status entry by Internal Ops for US returns.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-29 \u2013 Self-Donate Selection: When the Return Logistics Team cannot secure a vendor for unboxed mattress pickup, they MUST act to select the \"Self-Donation\" option in the vendor list. This provides the customer with self-donation instructions. The customer must then complete donation, provide photo proof, and contact CX for manual return processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>BR-30 \u2013 Furniture Return Destinations: When calling the shipping API for furniture returns, the system must use region-specific destinations: Canada (CA) returns go to Caledonia warehouse; United States (US) returns go to the original shipping warehouse (LA or NJ).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"08-business-rules.html#appendix-rules","title":"Appendix Rules","text":"<ul> <li>B-1 \u2013 Reason Inheritance: Each subcategory inherits the return reasons and mappings exactly as provided in the source tables.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"08-business-rules.html#discussion","title":"Discussion","text":"<p>\ud83d\udcac Comments for this page are available in Giscus.

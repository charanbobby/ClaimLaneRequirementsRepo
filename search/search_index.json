Third-party vendor orders do not proceed through Claimlane; vendor instructions are shown instead. Customer Intent Selection \u2013 The customer chooses to start a return, warranty claim or another return type (if configured). The flow branches accordingly. Order Lookup \u2013 For online orders the customer must enter their email and order number. Both fields must match exactly with the WooCommerce record; otherwise no order details are displayed. Display Order Items & Eligibility \u2013 All items on the order are shown with variant image, colour, category and eligibility status (e.g., Eligible, Trial Ended, Final Sale, Already Returned). Eligibility is computed using product category, return window, trial length, final sale rules, channel and delivered date. Item Selection \u2013 The customer selects one or more eligible items (partial quantities allowed). Category filtering hides items not applicable to the selected return type. A minimum of one item is required; a soft warning is triggered if more than two units of the same product type are selected. Reason Selection \u2013 The customer chooses a reason for each selected item from pre-configured lists. Return reasons map to WooCommerce refund reasons; warranty claim reasons are category-specific and do not allow \"Other/Change of Mind\". Selecting a damage or defective reason triggers documentation upload requirements. Documentation Upload \u2013 For claims and damage returns, customers must provide required documentation (e.g., photos of base, measurements, visible tags, invoice copy, lot number). The required documentation depends on the claim reason and product category. Logistics & Labels \u2013 If the product is eligible for a label, the customer enters the number of boxes (1\u201320) and a label is generated per box. For boxed mattresses, pickup instructions and photo requirements are shown. For unboxed mattresses or oversized furniture, vendor approval and freight rules apply. Tracking numbers are stored in the ticket. Ticket Creation \u2013 The Claimlane ticket stores order details, customer details, selected items and quantities, documentation, labels, return or claim reason, eligibility status and tags (product category, issue type). Duplicate tickets for the same items within a short window are prevented. Backend Actions \u2013 Upon submission the system triggers automatic refunds via WooCommerce (where supported) and/or creates replacement orders for approved warranty claims. Exception flows handle POS returns, vendor review requirements, manual refunds and customer service overrides.

Once Giscus is configured, the discussion thread for this page will appear here.","title":"Discussion"},{"location":"06-functional-requirements.html","text":"Functional Requirements The following requirements describe what the portal must do. Each requirement is assigned a reference number (FR-x) and grouped by functional area. Purchase Channel and Intent Selection FR-1 \u2013 Channel Selection UI: Provide a start screen where the customer chooses their purchase channel (silkandsnow.com/.ca, retail store, Shopify order, POS purchase, third-party vendor). When \"Third-Party Vendor\" is selected, the portal must show vendor instructions and block further portal steps. Only US and Canadian channels are available. FR-2 \u2013 Intent Selection: After channel selection, present options for \"Return\", \"Warranty Claim\", or other return type (configurable). The selection determines which subsequent screens and logic apply. Order Lookup and Security FR-3 \u2013 Order Lookup Fields: For online orders, display fields for email and order number. Both are required and must exactly match a WooCommerce order before showing any order details. FR-4 \u2013 Input Validation: Validate email format and trim leading/trailing spaces for both email and order number. Show clear error messages for missing or invalid fields. FR-5 \u2013 Order Retrieval: When email and order number match, retrieve and display the corresponding order details. If no match is found, inform the customer without revealing any order information. Item Display and Eligibility FR-6 \u2013 Display Items: Show all items on the order with their variant image, colour, size, category, quantity and status (e.g., \"Eligible\", \"Trial Ended\", \"Final Sale\", \"Already Returned\"). FR-7 \u2013 Eligibility Calculation: Compute eligibility for each item using the delivered date plus return period (per category), final sale flags, trial windows, prior returns and channel restrictions. Items that are past the return window, final sale, already returned or from an incorrect channel must be marked \"Not Eligible\". Mattresses returned within 30 nights should trigger a soft warning but remain eligible; unboxed mattresses and furniture without packaging should be flagged as \"Conditionally Eligible\" requiring vendor approval or admin flags. FR-8 \u2013 Category Filtering: Hide items that do not belong to the selected return type (e.g., returning accessories should not show mattresses). FR-9 \u2013 Bundles Handling: Identify bundle items and apply bundle rules (full bundle return vs. partial return with prorated refund). When a gift with purchase is returned, require the gift to be returned or deduct its value. Item Selection FR-10 \u2013 Item Selection: Allow the customer to select one or more eligible items and specify quantities (up to the purchased quantity). Prevent selection of more than two units of the same product type with a soft warning and flag the ticket for \"Quantity Limit Exceeded\" if over the limit. FR-11 \u2013 Validate Selection: Require at least one item to be selected before proceeding. If no item is selected, display a validation message. Reason Selection and Mapping FR-12 \u2013 Return Reasons: Present a dropdown of customer-facing return reasons based on the product category and language. Include \"Other/Change of Mind\" for returns where permitted and hide it for warranty claims. If \"Other\" is selected, provide a text field for additional details. FR-13 \u2013 Claim Reasons: Provide a category-specific list of warranty claim reasons with business-approved wording. Do not allow \"Other\" or change-of-mind reasons for claims. FR-14 \u2013 Reason Mapping: Map each selected customer reason to the corresponding WooCommerce refund reason for reporting and refund processing. Documentation Capture FR-15 \u2013 Documentation Requirements: Based on the product category and claim reason, determine the required documentation (e.g., base photos, measurement photos, tag photos, lot number, invoice copy, description). Present upload fields accordingly. FR-16 \u2013 Upload Validation: Enforce required documentation before submission. Validate file types, sizes and image clarity; provide user feedback when uploads fail and allow retry. FR-17 \u2013 General Documentation: Collect lot number and detailed description for all claims and require an invoice when the purchase was made through a retail store or third-party vendor. Logistics and Label Generation FR-18 \u2013 Box Count Input: When generating return labels, prompt the customer to enter the number of boxes (1\u201320) and validate the value. If no boxes are entered, require at least one box. FR-19 \u2013 Label Generation: Integrate with the selected shipping carrier API to generate one label per box using the customer's shipping address, item weight and dimensions. Use fallback weights when master data is missing. Store tracking numbers and prevent duplicate labels on reprints. FR-20 \u2013 Pickup & Freight Rules: For boxed mattresses, provide drop-off instructions. For unboxed mattresses or oversized furniture, trigger a vendor approval flow and use freight or special services based on weight and dimensions. Show warnings when original packaging is missing and flag the ticket for \u201cMissing Packaging\u201d. FR-21 \u2013 Label Display & Reprints: Show generated labels and tracking information to the customer. Allow re-printing without creating new labels or incurring extra charges. Ticket Creation and Backend Integration FR-22 \u2013 Ticket Creation: Upon submission, create a Claimlane ticket capturing customer and order details, selected items, reasons, documentation, eligibility status, labels, tags (product category and issue type) and notes. Prevent duplicate tickets for the same items within a short timeframe. FR-23 \u2013 Refund Processing: For eligible returns with supported payment gateways, automatically initiate a WooCommerce refund adjusting quantities and inventory. For partial refunds, adjust only the line item amount and leave inventory unchanged. If the gateway or currency does not support automated refunds, mark the ticket for manual refund and notify customer service. FR-24 \u2013 Replacement Order Creation: For approved warranty claims, create a WooCommerce order for replacement items using the customer's billing/shipping details, set the order status to \"Processing\" and notify the customer via WooCommerce. FR-25 \u2013 Exception Handling: Support exception flows, including manual POS returns, vendor review required (e.g., unboxed mattresses, furniture without packaging), manual refunds due to gateway issues and customer service overrides. Maintain logs and alerts for any failures during API calls (ticket creation, label generation, refund processing) with clear guidance to the customer. User Experience and Messaging FR-26 \u2013 UX Navigation: Provide a clear \"Start Over\" button after order lookup to allow customers to cancel and restart the process. Preserve session state when navigating back or refreshing pages and handle double submits gracefully (only one ticket/refund is created). FR-27 \u2013 Help & Support: Include a \"Help\" page that only displays the Silk & Snow support email and a link to the Silk & Snow chatbot. Do not include telephone numbers or other channels unless explicitly approved.

User stories are expressed in the format: As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]. Each story includes acceptance criteria derived from the testing worksheet. Epic 1 \u2013 Start & Authentication Flow Feature 1.1 \u2013 Channel & Intent Selection US-1.1.1 \u2013 Select Purchase Channel As a customer, I want to choose where I purchased my item (website, retail store, Shopify, POS or third-party vendor) so that the portal can route my request appropriately. Acceptance Criteria The start screen lists only US and Canadian channels. Selecting a third-party vendor shows vendor instructions and ends the flow. Selecting a physical store or other vendor displays store-specific information. US-1.1.2 \u2013 Select Return or Claim Type As a customer, I want to indicate whether I'm returning a product or submitting a warranty claim so that the system applies the correct rules. Acceptance Criteria Return options include \"Return\" and \"Warranty Claim\". Changing the selection resets the workflow without retaining stale data. Feature 1.2 \u2013 Order Lookup US-1.2.1 \u2013 Secure Order Lookup As a customer, I want to find my online order by entering my email and order number so that only my order information is displayed. Acceptance Criteria Both email and order number are required; validation errors appear for empty or invalid fields. Leading/trailing spaces are trimmed. If fields do not match a WooCommerce order, the system shows \"order not found\" without revealing details. Valid combinations retrieve the order and proceed to item selection. Epic 2 \u2013 Item Display & Selection Feature 2.1 \u2013 Display Items & Eligibility US-2.1.1 \u2013 View Purchased Items As a customer, I want to see all items in my order with images, colours and eligibility status so that I can select what to return. Acceptance Criteria Items are accurately displayed with name, image, colour and quantity. Items marked as final sale (e.g., custom hybrid mattress) are clearly labelled and cannot be selected. Items outside their return/trial window show an ineligible status. Soft warnings appear for mattresses returned within 30 nights and furniture returns without packaging. Category filtering hides non-relevant items when a specific return category is chosen. Feature 2.2 \u2013 Item Selection & Quantity US-2.2.1 \u2013 Select Items and Quantities As a customer, I want to select one or more eligible items and specify quantities so that I can return exactly what I intend. Acceptance Criteria The user can select multiple items or partial quantities. Trying to proceed with no items selected produces a validation error. Selecting more than two of the same product shows a soft warning. Bundle rules apply when a bundle item is returned. Epic 3 \u2013 Reason Selection & Documentation Feature 3.1 \u2013 Reason Capture US-3.1.1 \u2013 Select Return Reason As a customer returning an item, I want to choose a reason from a list so that the system can process my refund correctly. Acceptance Criteria The reason list is category-specific and matches marketing-approved options. Selecting \"Other\" displays a required text field. Selecting a damage/defective reason requires photo uploads. Each item stores its own reason. Proceeding without selecting a reason is blocked. US-3.1.2 \u2013 Select Claim Reason As a customer filing a warranty claim, I want to select a predefined claim reason appropriate to the product category so that my documentation requirements are clear. Acceptance Criteria Only claim reasons approved by Silk & Snow are presented; \"Other/Change of Mind\" is not offered. Each claim reason triggers specific documentation fields per the claim documentation table (Appendix A). Feature 3.2 \u2013 Documentation Upload US-3.2.1 \u2013 Provide Required Documentation As a customer with a claim or damage return, I want to upload photos, measurements, lot numbers and invoices as required so that my claim can be processed. Acceptance Criteria The portal displays required fields based on the selected claim reason and product category. Mandatory fields must be completed before submission. Unsupported file types or over-sized uploads are rejected with clear messages. Network errors during upload allow retry without losing form state. Epic 4 \u2013 Logistics & Label Management Feature 4.1 \u2013 Label Generation US-4.1.1 \u2013 Specify Number of Boxes As a customer returning items, I want to indicate how many boxes I will ship so that I receive the correct number of return labels. Acceptance Criteria The box count must be between 1 and 20. Entering 0 or a number above 20 triggers validation errors. US-4.1.2 \u2013 Generate Labels As a customer, I want the portal to generate shipping labels with accurate weights and dimensions so that I can return my items easily. Acceptance Criteria Each box generates a unique label and tracking number. Weight and dimension logic splits, sums or uses dimensional weight as appropriate. Missing weight triggers fallback values. The customer's shipping address appears correctly on all labels. US-4.1.3 \u2013 Handle Carrier Responses As a customer, I want errors from the carrier service to be handled gracefully so that I know how to proceed. Acceptance Criteria Temporary carrier errors allow retry without duplicating labels. Extended outages display fallback instructions to contact support. Re-printing a label retrieves the same label string. Epic 5 \u2013 Ticketing & Back-End Processing Feature 5.1 \u2013 Ticket Creation & Storage US-5.1.1 \u2013 Create Ticket As a customer, I want a ticket created with all my return/claim information so that customer service can track and act upon it. Acceptance Criteria Ticket includes contact details, selected items, quantities, documentation, labels and reasons. A ticket is created immediately after submission; failures display a friendly message and notify support. Duplicate tickets are prevented. US-5.1.2 \u2013 Ticket for Physical Store Returns As a customer returning an item purchased in a retail store, I want a ticket created for analytics even if the refund is processed manually so that Silk & Snow can track return volumes. Acceptance Criteria Ticket indicates external vendor and does not trigger automatic refund logic. Staff can view and act on the ticket in Claimlane. Feature 5.2 \u2013 Refund Processing US-5.2.1 \u2013 Automatic Refund As a customer returning an item, I want my refund processed automatically where supported so that I receive my money back quickly. Acceptance Criteria For supported gateways (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, integrated BNPL), the system initiates a WooCommerce refund and updates inventory appropriately. Partial refunds adjust only the line item amount and not inventory. POS orders and unsupported gateways trigger manual refund instructions. Duplicate or currency mismatch refunds are prevented. Refund status and transaction IDs are stored in the ticket. Feature 5.3 \u2013 Replacement Orders US-5.3.1 \u2013 Create Replacement Order As a customer with an approved warranty claim, I want the system to create a replacement order using my existing shipping details so that I receive my replacement without extra steps. Acceptance Criteria Replacement orders are created in WooCommerce with status \"Processing\". The customer receives an email notification from WooCommerce. Replacement order logic follows warranty rules by product. Epic 6 \u2013 Exception & Edge Cases US-6.1 \u2013 Vendor Approval As a customer returning an unboxed mattress or large furniture item, I want the system to request vendor approval before generating a label so that oversized or unpackaged returns are handled properly. Acceptance Criteria Unboxed mattresses prompt the customer for additional photos and the ticket is flagged for vendor review. Furniture without packaging triggers a warning to the customer and an admin flag. Approval decisions are recorded in the ticket and update the flow. US-6.2 \u2013 Donation Path As a customer with an open-box mattress return, I want to donate my mattress through an approved partner so that I can complete my return via donation. Acceptance Criteria The portal displays donation partner details where available. If the customer's address is outside the service area, instructions to contact support are provided. US-6.3 \u2013 Timeouts & Re-Entries As a customer, I want to resume my return if my session times out or I need to re-enter the portal so that I do not lose progress. Acceptance Criteria Session timeouts after label generation but before final confirmation still preserve tickets and labels. If the user restarts the process, only items not yet returned are shown. Refreshing or double-submitting does not create duplicate tickets or refunds. Epic 7 \u2013 User Experience & Accessibility US-7.1 \u2013 UX Messages As a customer, I want clear and contextual messages during each step of the return or claim process so that I understand what is happening. Acceptance Criteria Eligibility messages specify the product and rule (e.g., \"Furniture must be returned within 30 days; this item is past the return window\"). Error messages cover invalid input, missing documentation, API failures, carrier errors and gateway errors. Marketing-approved copy is used across all screens and for all languages. US-7.2 \u2013 Accessibility & Responsiveness As any user, I want to navigate the portal using only a keyboard and have the pages render correctly on mobile devices so that the portal is accessible. Acceptance Criteria All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard and labelled appropriately. Screens adapt to smaller screen sizes while maintaining functionality.

Third-party vendor orders do not proceed through Claimlane; vendor instructions are shown instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Intent Selection \u2013 The customer chooses to start a return, warranty claim or another return type (if configured). The flow branches accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Order Lookup \u2013 For online orders the customer must enter their email and order number. Both fields must match exactly with the WooCommerce record; otherwise no order details are displayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display Order Items &amp; Eligibility \u2013 All items on the order are shown with variant image, colour, category and eligibility status (e.g., Eligible, Trial Ended, Final Sale, Already Returned). Eligibility is computed using product category, return window, trial length, final sale rules, channel and delivered date.</p> </li> <li> <p>Item Selection \u2013 The customer selects one or more eligible items (partial quantities allowed). Category filtering hides items not applicable to the selected return type. A minimum of one item is required; a soft warning is triggered if more than two units of the same product type are selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reason Selection \u2013 The customer chooses a reason for each selected item from pre-configured lists. Return reasons map to WooCommerce refund reasons; warranty claim reasons are category-specific and do not allow \"Other/Change of Mind\". Selecting a damage or defective reason triggers documentation upload requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documentation Upload \u2013 For claims and damage returns, customers must provide required documentation (e.g., photos of base, measurements, visible tags, invoice copy, lot number). The required documentation depends on the claim reason and product category.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logistics &amp; Labels \u2013 If the product is eligible for a label, the customer enters the number of boxes (1\u201320) and a label is generated per box. For boxed mattresses, pickup instructions and photo requirements are shown. For unboxed mattresses or oversized furniture, vendor approval and freight rules apply. Tracking numbers are stored in the ticket.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ticket Creation \u2013 The Claimlane ticket stores order details, customer details, selected items and quantities, documentation, labels, return or claim reason, eligibility status and tags (product category, issue type). Duplicate tickets for the same items within a short window are prevented.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backend Actions \u2013 Upon submission the system triggers automatic refunds via WooCommerce (where supported) and/or creates replacement orders for approved warranty claims. Exception flows handle POS returns, vendor review requirements, manual refunds and customer service overrides.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"05-process-high-level.html#visual-process-flow","title":"Visual Process Flow","text":"<pre><code>flowchart TB\n\n    A([\"Where did you purchase?\"]) --&gt; B[\"Silkandsnow.com\"] &amp; C[\"Retail store\"] &amp; D[\"Third-party vendor\"]\n    D --&gt; D1[\"Follow vendor specific return / warranty process\"]\n    B --&gt; B0[\"How can we help you?\"]\n    B0 --&gt; B1[\"Warranty claim\"] &amp; B2[\"Mattress return\"] &amp; B3[\"Furniture / Accessory / Bedding return\"] &amp; B4[\"Other returns\"]\n    B2 --&gt; M1[\"Select the product\"]\n    M1 --&gt; M2{\"Is it boxed?\"}\n    M2 -- Yes --&gt; M3[\"Confirm customer details: name, email, phone, address, pickup date\"]\n    M3 --&gt; M4[\"Collect photos of mattress and law tag\"]\n    M4 --&gt; M5[\"Provide customer with return label and confirmation email\"]\n    M5 --&gt; M6[\"Vendor picks up product\"]\n    M6 --&gt; M7[\"Notify internal team and submit order for refund\"]\n    M2 -- No --&gt; M8[\"Confirm customer details and reason for unboxed return\"]\n    M8 --&gt; M9[\"Collect photos of product and law tag for review\"]\n    M9 --&gt; M10[\"Send details to vendor for condition review\"]\n    M10 --&gt; M11[\"Vendor approves pickup\"]\n    M11 --&gt; M6\n    B3 --&gt; F1[\"Select the product\"]\n    F1 --&gt; F2[\"Collect customer details and photos of product\"]\n    F2 --&gt; F3[\"Provide customer with return label and instructions\"]\n    F3 --&gt; F4[\"Product received by vendor\"]\n    F4 --&gt; F5[\"Notify internal team and process refund / exchange\"]\n    B4 --&gt; O1[\"Select the product\"]\n    O1 --&gt; O2[\"Collect details and photos as needed\"]\n    O2 --&gt; O3[\"Provide customer with return label or next steps\"]\n    O3 --&gt; O4[\"Item received and reviewed\"]\n    O4 --&gt; O5[\"Process refund / replacement\"]\n    B1 --&gt; W1[\"Collect order details, photos and description of issue\"]\n    W1 --&gt; W2[\"Send case to vendor / warranty team for review\"]\n    W2 --&gt; W3{\"Approved?\"}\n    W3 -- Yes --&gt; W4[\"Arrange replacement / repair or refund\"]\n    W3 -- No --&gt; W5[\"Communicate decision and options to customer\"]\n    C --&gt; C1[\"Shopify store order\"] &amp; C2[\"In-store POS purchase\"]\n    C1 --&gt; CS0[\"How can we help you?\"]\n    CS0 --&gt; CS1[\"Mattress / product return\"] &amp; CS2[\"Warranty claim\"]\n    CS1 --&gt; CS3[\"Select product and verify original order\"]\n    CS3 --&gt; CS4{\"Is it boxed?\"}\n    CS4 -- Yes --&gt; CS5[\"Collect customer details and photos if needed\"]\n    CS4 -- No --&gt; CS6[\"Collect details and photos including law tag\"]\n    CS5 --&gt; CS7[\"Provide return label or store instructions\"]\n    CS6 --&gt; CS7\n    CS7 --&gt; CS8[\"Vendor / warehouse receives product\"]\n    CS8 --&gt; CS9[\"Notify internal team and process refund\"]\n    CS2 --&gt; CS10[\"Collect order details and photos for warranty\"]\n    CS10 --&gt; CS11[\"Submit claim to vendor / warranty team\"]\n    CS11 --&gt; CS12{\"Approved?\"}\n    CS12 -- Yes --&gt; CS13[\"Arrange replacement / repair or refund\"]\n    CS12 -- No --&gt; CS14[\"Communicate decision and options to customer\"]\n    C2 --&gt; S0[\"How can we help you?\"]\n    S0 --&gt; S1[\"Mattress / product return\"] &amp; S2[\"Warranty claim\"]\n    S1 --&gt; S3[\"Verify receipt and purchase details\"]\n    S3 --&gt; S4{\"Within store return rules?\"}\n    S4 -- Yes --&gt; S5[\"Accept item in store and create return in POS\"]\n    S5 --&gt; S6[\"Ship item to vendor / warehouse if required\"]\n    S6 --&gt; S7[\"Refund or exchange completed in store\"]\n    S4 -- No --&gt; S8[\"Escalate to customer service for exception handling\"]\n    S2 --&gt; S9[\"Collect receipt, photos and issue description\"]\n    S9 --&gt; S10[\"Submit warranty case to vendor / internal team\"]\n    S10 --&gt; S11{\"Approved?\"}\n    S11 -- Yes --&gt; S12[\"Provide replacement / repair or refund\"]\n    S11 -- No --&gt; S13[\"Communicate decision and options to customer\"]</code></pre>"},{"location":"05-process-high-level.html#discussion","title":"Discussion","text":"<p>\ud83d\udcac Comments for this page are available in Giscus.
